# LearnWithMazes
Finishing thesis for Software Engineering in Karadeniz Technical University. Needs a lot of improvements, I'm planing to do so. 

It's connected to MongoDB Atlas free-use server. That's why, navigating in the app can be slow time to time. I wanted to display database changes real time, so I added 
some CRUD operations in screen changes. 
I'm planning to add a "setup" file too. 
Main goal of the app is helping elementery level students to study math. Mazes help people to focus.
Creating your-own mazes helps creative thinking. 
I knowingly didn't add "e-mail" section to the sign-up part to motivate new users to signing up.
I added 40 mazes as basic levels "play levels" page.
I added a couple of mazes from users I created to test the functions.
On create-maze page there are a couple of things i want to add. But at the moment users can create their own mazes, save them to the database, 
and add questions for the doors they added. Like i said, main goal is study math. So no door mazes are not allowed in the app.
But of course, user's can add "empty" questions. 
While trying to make everything work, I didn't follow SOLID principles or any design pattern. I tried to apply recommendations of Robert C. Martin.
From his book of Clean Code. But i know that i have to make a lot of improvements to the code.
